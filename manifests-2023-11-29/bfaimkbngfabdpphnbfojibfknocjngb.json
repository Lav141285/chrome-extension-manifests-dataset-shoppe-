  http://I do not collect ANY user data. Since it's not collected, there are no
  storage or data sale worries. I am quite possibly the laziest dev to ever
  publish a chrome extension. This whole extension is a whopping 5 lines of code
  meant just for laughs. I have no free time for  collecting socks off my floor
  let alone checking up on whatever might even be possible to collect - I'm not
  even sure of the possibilities here. I like my data to be safe and want your
  data to be safe too.  Of the 5 whole users of this extension, I'm pretty sure
  3 of them are actually me on different devices. If for some odd reason more
  people do show up, I plan to continue to fully ignore all users including
  myself.
