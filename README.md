# Chrome Extension `manifest.json` Dataset (>10k Extensions)

This repository contains >10k [`manifest.json`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) files for extensions hosted in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions). These were collected via scraping Chrome Web Store. Some metadata has been added as front matter to the manifests in order to provide context: extension name and publisher, rating and user count.

This has been inspired by a [similar repository](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset/) created by [@IAmMandatory](https://twitter.com/IAmMandatory). Captures for two point in time have been created but I cannot promise that any updates will happen in future. It's meant to be useful for analysis of the Chrome extension ecosystem, such as what permissions are requested, common Content Security Policies, etc.
